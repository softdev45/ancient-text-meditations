      [Jhn 14:6 KJV] Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rev 19:13 KJV] And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.

      [Jhn 6:35, 39-40, 45-48, 51, 53-54, 65 KJV] And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me
      shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
      <br>
      ... And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing,
      but should raise it up again at the last day.
      <br> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have
      everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. <br>
      ... It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and
      hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.
      <br>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. <br>
      Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. <br>
      ... I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and
      the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <br>
      ... Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and
      drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I
      will raise him up at the last day. <br>
      ... And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my
      Father.
